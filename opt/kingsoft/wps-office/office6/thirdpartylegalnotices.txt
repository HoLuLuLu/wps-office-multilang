                              2006-Jan-27
  
                      Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
            David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



  Introduction
  ============

    The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.
  
    This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
  
    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

      o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 
      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
  
      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        FreeType code. (`credits')
  
    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


    Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
    encourage you to use the following text:

     """
      Portions of this software are copyright � <year> The FreeType
      Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
     """

    Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
    actually use.


  Legal Terms
  ===========

  0. Definitions
  --------------

    Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.
  
    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.

    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.

    The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.

Pango

  Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
  on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
  is needed; however, most of the work on Pango so far has been done using 
  the GTK+ widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text
  and font handling for GTK+-2.x.

  Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used
  with different font backends. There are three basic backends, with
  multiple options for rendering with each.

   - Client side fonts using the FreeType and fontconfig libraries.
     Rendering can be with with Cairo or Xft libraries, or directly
     to an in-memory buffer with no additional libraries.

   - Native fonts on Microsoft Windows using Uniscribe for complex
     script handling. Rendering can be done via Cairo or directly
     using the native Win32 API.

   - Native fonts on MacOS X with the CoreText framework, rendering via
     Cairo.

  The integration of Pango with Cairo (http://cairographics.org)
  provides a complete solution with high quality text handling 
  and graphics rendering.

  Dynamically loaded modules then handle text layout for particular
  combinations of script and font backend.

  As well as the low level layout rendering routines, Pango includes
  PangoLayout, a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text,
  and routines to assist in editing internationalized text.

  For more information about Pango, see:

   http://www.pango.org/

  Dependencies
  ============

  Pango depends on the GLib library; more information about GLib can
  be found at http://www.gtk.org/.

  To use the Free Software stack backend, Pango depends on the following
  libraries:

    * fontconfig for font discovery (http://www.fontconfig.org),

    * FreeType for font access (http://www.freetype.org),

    * HarfBuzz for complex text shaping (http://www.harfbuzz.org/)

  Cairo support depends on the Cairo library (http://cairographics.org).
  The Cairo backend is the preferred backend to use Pango with and is
  subject of most of the development in the future.  It has the
  advantage that the same code can be used for display and printing.

  We suggest using Pango with Cairo as described above, but you can also
  do X-specific rendering using the Xft library. The Xft backend uses
  version 2 of the Xft library to manage client side fonts. Version 2 of
  Xft is available from http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/.  You'll
  need the libXft package, and possibly the libXrender and renderext
  packages as well.  You'll also need fontconfig (see below.)

  Installation of Pango on Win32 is possible, but is not documented
  here. See http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html

  Notes
  =====

   - By default, Pango tries to build itself so that no explicit
     dependency on Xft or FreeType will be introduced in apps that
     link to Pango. This is to avoid compatibility problems with
     changes in the Xft or FreeType API's or ABI's. Specifying 
     --enable-explicit-deps or --enable-static when configuring Pango 
     will defeat this and should be avoided if possible.

  License
  =======

  Most of the code of Pango is licensed under the terms of the 
  GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) - see the file COPYING for details.

  The OpenType code in pango/opentype is derived from the FreeType 
  project (http://www.freetype.org) and is dual-licensed under the 
  GNU General Public License and the FreeType license. See see
  pango/opentype/FT-license.txt for full details of the FreeType 
  license.

  Note that binary distributions of Pango must include a disclaimer 
  that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, 
  in the distribution documentation; for instance, by including this 
  README file.

MyThes

  MyThes is a simple thesaurus that uses a structured
  text data file and an index file with binary search
  to lookup words and phrases and return information
  on part of speech, meanings, and synonyms
  
  MyThes was originall written to provide a thesaurus
  for the OpenOffice.org project 
  
  The Main features of MyThes are:
  
  1. written in C++ to make it easier to interface with 
     LibreOffice, OpenOffice, AbiWord, Pspell, etc
  
  2. it is stateless, uses no static variables and
     should be completely reentrant with no ifdefs  
  
  3. it compiles with -ansi and -pedantic and -Wall
     with no warnigns so it shouldbe quite portable
  
  4. it uses a simple perl program to read the structured
     text file and create the index needed for binary
     searching
  
  5. it is very simple with *lots* of comments.
     The main "smarts" are in the structure of the
     text file that makes up the thesaurus data
  
  6. It comes with a ready-to-go structured thesaurus
     data file for en_US extracted from the WordNet-2.0 data.
  
     Please see WordNet_license.txt and WordNet_readme.txt
     for more information on the very useful project!
  
     See http://www.danielnaber.de/wn2ooo/ for utilities to
     regenerate an up to date English thesaurus from the most
     recent WordNet data.
     
  7. The source code has a BSD license (and no advertising clause)
  
  
  MyThes comes with a simple example program that looks up some words and returns
  meanings and synonyms.
  
  To build it simply do the following:
  
  unzip mythes.zip
  cd mythes
  ./configure
  make
  
  To run the example program:
  ./example th_en_US_new.idx th_en_US_new.dat checkme.lst
  
  To run the example program with stemming and morphological generation:
  e.g. to check mouse, mice, rodents, eats, eaten, ate, eating etc. words
  ./example morph.idx morph.dat morph.lst morph.aff morph.dic
  
  NOTE: this is only an example and test environment for dictionary developers,
  full English stemming and morphological generation needs an improved
  English Hunspell dictionary.
