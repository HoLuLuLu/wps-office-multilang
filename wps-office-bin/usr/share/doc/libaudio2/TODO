- remove obsolete 'register' usage.

- be able to handle larger sample rates like 96Khz.  The protocol limits
  the sample rate to an unsigned short, which will require a protocol
  change to fix.

- auplay
	- playing other formats than .au from stdin (cmdline opt?)

- Automatic track matching: server automatically inserts a bundler to
  do the right thing.

- Generate events when device attributes are changed or buckets are destroyed.

- Allow an output device to be used as an input.  The resulting data would
  be what was last sent to that device.  This would allow a client to display
  a meter that would indicate what was actually coming out of a speaker, even
  if the data was from multiple clients.

- Improve I/O error handling, possibly by inserting a pseudo event into
  the event queue.
