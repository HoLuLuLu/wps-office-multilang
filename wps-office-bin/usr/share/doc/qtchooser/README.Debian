We currently patch qtchooser to make it look for configs
in three additional directories:

- /usr/share/qtchooser: holds qtx-triplet.conf configs.
  They are installed by libqtcore with it's arch triplet. In this way apps can
  call it's specific arch tools.

- /usr/lib/$(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)/qtchooser: holds qtx.conf and default.conf for
  the specific arch.

- /usr/lib/$(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)/qt-default/qtchooser: holds a default.conf which
  points to Qt4. In this way the Qt4 packages already in the archive should not
  FTBFS when we introduce qtchooser in unstable. Exporting QT_SELECT=qt4 or
  build-depending on qt4-default is recommended.
