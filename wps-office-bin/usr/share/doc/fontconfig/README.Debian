*** IMPORTANT ***

Recently, fontconfig changed to not include bitmapped fonts in the
default font set.  There is now a Debconf question about this.

If you wish to enable bitmapped fonts manually, either reconfigure this
package (with dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config), or remove the 
symbolic link /etc/fonts/conf.d/30-debconf-no-bitmaps.conf

*****************


How fonts are handled in Debian:
--------------------------------

Fontconfig is a library which handles font configuration and access at
the system level. It is the foundation for a new font handling in X
applications (but can also be useful without X).

Applications not using fontconfig are accessing their fonts through
the X server. Font packages for these applications are named xfonts-*.
You can also use TrueType fonts with these applications if you install
the x-ttcidfont-conf package, which connects the X server to defoma:
fonts included in ttf-* packages or added manually using dfontmgr can
then be used in these programs.
A few of these applications, using Xft1, can benefit of antialiasing 
with vector fonts, but it is deprecated.

The new font renderer in X is called freetype2, and applications
using it access fonts on the client side. Most of them (including all
GTK2/GNOME2 and KDE3 applications) do it using fontconfig, which
provides listing and matching facilities for all fonts installed on the
system. Any font installed in /usr/share/fonts or ~/.fonts will be 
accessible to these applications. This is now also true for fonts added
using defoma.

These programs can all benefit from antialiasing, autohinting and
sub-pixel rendering. You can configure it through fontconfig, using
debconf (dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config), or by changing
links in /etc/fonts/conf.d by hand.
