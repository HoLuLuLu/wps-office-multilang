1.0) General

1.1) What is the Network Audio System?

     In a nutshell, NAS is the audio equivalent of an X display
     server.

     The Network Audio System (NAS) was developed by NCD for playing,
     recording, and manipulating audio data over a network.  Like the
     X Window System, it uses the client/server model to separate
     applications from the specific drivers that control audio input
     and output devices.

     Key features of the Network Audio System include:

         o   Device-independent audio over the network
         o   Lots of audio file and data formats
         o   Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
         o   Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
         o   Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
         o   Use by a growing number of ISVs
         o   Small size
         o   Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms

1.2) Where can I get it?

     The latest stable and development releases of NAS can be obtained
     from:

1.3) Is there a mailing list?

     Yes.  nas@radscan.com is a low volume mailing list for general
     discussion of the Network Audio System.  Send a message to
     majordomo@radscan.com with a line in the body containing the
     folowing text:

4.0) Common Issues

4.1) When I try to start nasd, I get an error 'could not create
     audio connection block info'. 

     This error can be cuased by a variety of reasons - usually
     related to some error occuring during the opening of the audio
     device.

     To find out what might have really gone wrong, run nasd with the
     '-d <n>' (debugging) and '-v' (verbose) options to get more
     information as to the real problem.  For example:

         nasd -v -d 99 

4.2) I'm having problems getting the NAS clients to work with my
     NCD X terminal.

     Some NCD X terminal models running NCDware 3.0.1 or greater
     support NCDaudio, NCD's X terminal implementation of the Network
     Audio System.  Audio clients shipped with a particular NCDware
     release should function correctly with that release.  However,
     the NAS protocol changed slightly after the release of NCDware
     3.0.1, making newer clients incompatible with older servers.  NAS
     clients should function correctly with NCDware
     3.1 or greater.  Please contact support@ncd.com if you have
     further questions about NAS on NCD products.

     [NOTE: I do not believe NCD actually provides any support for NAS
     on their X terminals anymore.]
