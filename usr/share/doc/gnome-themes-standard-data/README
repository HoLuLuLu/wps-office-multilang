=====================
gnome-themes-standard
=====================

This package used to contain various components of the default GNOME 3 theme.
At this point, most of the contents has moved elsewhere. The Adwaita and
HighContrast themes are now part of GTK+ 3 itself, and the HighContrastInverse
and LowConstrast themes have been discontinued. Only the GTK+ 2 versions of
the Adwaita and HighConstrast themes still reside in this module.


How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME Bugzilla[1], in the "gnome-themes-standard"
product.
