D-Bus AT-SPI
------------

This version of at-spi is a major break from version 1.x.
It has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than
ORBIT / CORBA for its transport protocol.

A page including instructions for testing, project status and
TODO items is kept up to date at:

        http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/AT-SPI_on_D-Bus

The mailing list used for general questions is:

        accessibility-atspi@lists.linux-foundation.org

For bug reports, feature requests, patches or enhancements please use
the AT-SPI project on bugzilla.gnome.org. Use the at-spi2-atk component for
bugs specific to this module.

A git repository with the latest development code is available at:

	git://git.gnome.org/at-spi2-atk

Code in this repository depends on at-spi2-core resources. The
at-spi2-core repository can be found at:

	git://git.gnome.org/at-spi2-core

More information
----------------

The project was started with a D-Bus performance review
the results of which are available on the GNOME wiki. Keep in
mind that the D-Bus AT-SPI design documents on this page
have not been kept up to date.

Contents of this package
------------------------

This package includes libatk-bridge, a library that bridges ATK to the new
D-Bus based AT-SPI, as well as a corresponding module for gtk+ 2.x. Gtk+ 3.x
now links against libatk-bridge directly rather than requiring it to be loaded
as a module.

These libraries depend on the at-spi2-core code that contains the daemon for
registering applications, D-Bus helper libraries and the AT-SPI D-Bus specifications.

Tests
-----

To run tests execute autogen.sh with '--with-tests=yes' parameter then
after 'make', type 'make check'.
Test result is available in tests/atk-test.log

Directory structure
-------------------

The directories within this package are arranged as follows:

    droute

        Contains a framework for registering objects
        with a D-Bus connection and for routing messages to
        the implementing object.

        Used by the ATK adaptor.

    atk-adaptor

        This directory contains code that bridges 
        the at-spi to the GTK+ toolkit, and which is
        loaded at runtime by GTK+-based Gnome applications.
        The 'bridge' automatically registers GTK+-2.0
        applications with the accessibility registry, 
        and relays UI events from application to registry.
        It is also responsible for servicing requests from
        the registry to register handlers for specific event
        types.

    tests

        Contains tests for atspi.
