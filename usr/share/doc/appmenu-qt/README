# Summary

This plugin provides appmenu support for Qt.

If your version of Qt is less than 4.8, you *need* a patched Qt for this to
work. A patch for Qt 4.7.3 can be found in the patches/ dir.

# Environment variables
- Set QT_X11_NO_NATIVE_MENUBAR to 1 to disable exposing menubars on DBus

- Set APPMENU_DISPLAY_BOTH to 1 to expose menubars on DBus but still show them
in the window
