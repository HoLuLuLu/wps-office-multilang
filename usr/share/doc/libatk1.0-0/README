This directory contains the ATK library.

For more information about ATK and accessibility in GNOME, see:
 http://projects.gnome.org/accessibility

Dependencies
============

ATK requires GLib >= 2.31.2. Information about GLib is available from
http://www.gtk.org/.

Getting the source code
=======================

You can get the source code of each ATK release as a tarball:
https://download.gnome.org/sources/atk/

You can also clone the ATK master branch from GNOME repository:
https://git.gnome.org/browse/atk

Building
========

To buid ATK from a release tarball, the usual is using autotool, as:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

To build ATK from a Git clone, run the autogen.sh script instead of
the configure one. Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure
you have libtool in your path.

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options
to autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system:
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=atk

You will need to create an account for yourself.

You can also mail the mailing list gnome-accessibility-devel@gnome.org
