summary: WPS Office Suite all languages with no internet connection
description: "ABOUT WPS OFFICE\nWPS Office, is an office productivity suite. WPS Office
  including Writer, Presentation and Spreadsheets, is a powerful office suite, which
  is able to process word file, produce wonderful slides, and analyze data as well.
  It is deeply compatible with all of the latest Microsoft Office file formats. It
  can easily open and read the documents created with Microsoft Office. This is the
  Linux version, and it's now a TESTING package. Website: http://wps-community.org\n\nABOUT
  THIS PACKAGE\nWPS-office snap package is shipped by default only with English and
  Chinese. Due to the non modifiable aspect of snap packages, it is currently impossible
  to install other languages and spellchecker.    \nThis package have been built with
  English (GB, US), French (FR), Indonesian (ID), Portuguese (BR, PT), Russian (RU)
  and Chinese (CN) interface, and English (AU, GB, US), Spanish (ES, MX), French (FR),
  Dutch (NL), Polish (PL), Portuguese (BR, PT) and Russian (RU) dictionnaries.\nMoreover
  Because I'm security freak and I don't trust china's privacy policy, I made this
  package without internet plug, which means that this version of WPS in unable to
  connect to the internet. I made this in order to keep your computer backdoor free
  and your data private.\nThe files used to create this packages are available at
  https://github.com/cyrpaut/wps-office-ann-lang-no-internet. Please feel free to
  help me upgrading this package. \n"
